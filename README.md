# haptic-sensory-play

This suite of sensory play games was designed for the Tanvas Tablet, a variable friction touch-screen display, based on insights from previous scholarly work involving children with sensory sensitivities and conversations with trained specialists, including occupational therapists, experts in learning disabilities and teachers. The application includes four main activities:

A letter tracing activity where the user may choose any letter from the English alphabet and feel textures as they trace it using their finger.

<img src="/Assets/Resources/main-menu-buttons-feedback-exploration.png" width="150" height="200">  
A feedback exploration activity where the user can toggle between a series of scenarios and feel textures as they drag a car along the tracks. Feedback may also be toggled between inside or outside the tracks.  
**Known bugs:**
* Upon navigating away from this interface, the car object may be removed from the environment. 
* Buttons to update the feedback settings can be pressed, but textures may not update accordingly.

A sandbox activity where the user can switch between different contents within the sandbox and feel the underlying textures.

<img src="/Assets/Resources/main-menu-buttons-drawing.png" width="150" height="200">  
A drawing activity where the user can choose from different types of paintbrushes and colors to create textured drawings within the interface.  
**Known bugs:**
* Upon switching between the different types of paintbrushes, the underlying textures may not be updating appropriately and user might feel the same texture across various paintbrushes.
